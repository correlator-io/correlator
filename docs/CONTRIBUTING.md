### Code Review

All code contributions will be reviewed by a maintainer of the project. The maintainer may provide feedback or request changes to the code. Please be patient during the review process.

## Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git https://github.com/correlator-io/correlator.git
cd correlator

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Quality Assurance

The project uses several code quality tools that can be run via Make commands:

```bash
# Format code with golangci
make fmt

# Run linting with golangci
make lint

# Run type checking with vet
make vet

# Run unit tests
make test-unit

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run all tests
make test
```

## Branch Naming Convention and Commit Message Format

The branch naming convention and commit message format are as follows:

- Branch naming convention: `type/branch-name`
- Commit message format: `type: commit message`

The `type` can be one of the following:

- `minor`: Minor changes or a new feature
- `major`: Major changes or breaking change
- `patch`: A bug fix
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks such as updating dependencies or configuration files or bootstrap code

### Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain consistency and clarity in our project history, all commit messages **must** follow the format: `type: commit message` and the **must** be signed, for example; `git commit -sm 'major: Add some AmazingFeature'`

#### Accepted Types
- **minor**: For minor changes or new features.
- **major**: For major changes or breaking changes.
- **patch**: For bug fixes.
- **chore**: For maintenance tasks, such as updating dependencies or configuration files or bootstrap code.

#### Examples
- `minor: Refactor cache implementation`
- `major: Add api endpoint`
- `patch: Fix null pointer in api endpoint handler`
- `chore: Update CI configuration`

#### Why This Matters
Using a consistent format for commit messages helps:
- Easily identify the purpose and impact of each commit
- Streamline the release process by automatically generating changelogs
- Improve collaboration and understanding among team members

Make sure to follow these guidelines for every commit to keep our project history clean and meaningful!

## Testing

All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by appropriate tests. We maintain strict separation between unit and integration tests using Go's `testing.Short()` flag.

### Test Types and Conventions

**Unit Tests**:
- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Use mocks/stubs for external dependencies
- Keep tests fast (< 100ms each)
- **Required**: Add this skip condition at the start of every unit test:
  ```go
  if !testing.Short() {
      t.Skip("skipping unit test in non-short mode")
  }
  ```

**Integration Tests**:
- Test end-to-end workflows with real external services
- Use testcontainers for database testing
- Allow longer timeouts (up to 10 minutes)
- **Required**: Add this skip condition at the start of every integration test:
  ```go
  if testing.Short() {
      t.Skip("skipping integration test in short mode")
  }
  ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests only (fast feedback loop)
make test-unit

# Run integration tests only (slower, with real services)
make test-integration

# Run all tests with coverage
make test
```

### Test File Organization

- Place test files alongside the code they test (e.g., `config.go` â†’ `config_test.go`)
- Use descriptive test function names that clearly indicate scope
- Follow table-driven test patterns for multiple test cases
